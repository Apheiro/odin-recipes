        <p>This classic chicken Schnitzel recipe sounds harder to make than it is. Plus, you get to pound out the day's stress.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Servings</li>
            <li>4 4-ounce skinless, boneless chicken breasts, pounded to 1/8-inch thickness Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (for dredging)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 cups (or more) whole wheat (or regular) panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>Chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Step 1 <br>
                Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Place flour on a plate. Beat eggs and Dijon mustard to blend in a shallow bowl or baking dish. Place 1 cup panko in another shallow bowl or baking dish, adding remaining 1 cup panko, or more, to dish as needed throughout process. Working with 1 chicken breast at a time, dredge in flour, shaking off excess, then dip into egg mixture, turning to coat evenly; carefully coat with panko, pressing panko gently to adhere to chicken. Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li> Step 2 <br> 
                Heat 1 Tbsp. oil and 1 Tbsp. butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat (pan should be large enough to hold 2 breasts). Add 2 chicken breasts to skillet and cook until golden brown on both sides, 8-10 minutes. Transfer chicken breasts to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt. Add remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and 1 Tbsp. butter to skillet and repeat with remaining chicken breasts. Transfer chicken breasts to plates and garnish each with parsley and a lemon wedge.</li>
        </ol>
