This is my first README

I have to make a quick introduction of what I have learned in the odin project, and what I will do in the next lesson.

First in this lesson I am going to do two projects with CSS and HTML. 

Before in the last lesson I learned all about how to create a website and make it functional I also learned the htm structure, the css structure, and all the basics of using git.

Now my knowledge will be tested with these two projects.
