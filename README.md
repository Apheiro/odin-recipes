# My first README ( •̀ ω ´•)✧

In my first project called [Odin-Recipes](apheiro.github.io/odin-recipes/) from "[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)", I am going to use everything I have learned, to develop this project and the next one after this one.

Acquired knowledge:</br>
● html structure.</br>
● css basics.</br>
● basic use of git (create commits, push, add).
